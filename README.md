## Safety

Rust ensures data race safety through the type system (`Send` and `Sync` marker traits) as well as the ownership and borrowing rules: it is not allowed to alias a mutable reference, so it is not possible to perform a data race.

## Overview

&nbsp; | Problem
------- | -------
Parallelism | Multi-core utilization
Concurrency | Single-core idleness

&nbsp; | Solution | Primitive | Type | Description | Examples
------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------
Parallelism | Multithreading | Thread | `T: Send` | Do work simultaneously on different threads | [`std::thread::spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html)
Concurrency | Single-threaded concurrency | Future | `Future` | Futures run concurrently on the same thread | [`futures::future::join`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/future/fn.join.html), [`futures::join`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/macro.join.html), [`tokio::join`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/macro.join.html)
Concurrency<br>+Parallelism | Multithreaded concurrency | Task | `T: Future + Send` | Tasks run concurrently to other tasks; the task may run on the current thread, or it may be sent to a different thread | [`async_std::task::spawn`](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/task/fn.spawn.html), [`tokio::task::spawn`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fn.spawn.html)

## Futures

``` rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}

pub enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}
```

- `Future` has to be `poll`ed (by the *executor*) to resume where it last yielded and make progress (async is *lazy*)
- `&mut Self` contains state (state machine)
- `Pin` the memory location because the future contains self-referential data
- `Context` contains the `Waker` to notify the executor that progress can be made
- async/await on futures is implemented by *generators*
- `async fn` and `async` blocks return `impl Future<Output = T>`
- calling `.await` attempts to resolve the `Future`: if the `Future` is blocked, it yields control; if progress can be made, the `Future` resumes

Futures form a tree of futures. The leaf futures commmunicate with the executor. The root future of a tree is called a *task*.

## Tasks and threads

Computation | Examples
------- | -------
Lightweight (e.g. <100 ms) | [`async_std::task::spawn`](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/task/fn.spawn.html), [`tokio::task::spawn`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/fn.spawn.html)
Extensive (e.g. >100 ms or I/O bound) | [`async_std::task::spawn_blocking`](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html), [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html)
Massive (e.g. running forever or CPU-bound) | [`std::thread::spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html)

## Streams

``` rust
pub trait Stream {
    type Item;
    fn poll_next(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>>;

    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) { ... }
}
```

- [`Stream<Item = T>`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html) is an asynchronous version of [`Iterator<Item = T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html), i.e., it does not block between each item yield

## Concurrency models

Model | Description
------- | -------
shared memory | threads operate on regions of shared memory
worker pools | many identical threads receive jobs from a shared job queue
actors | many different job queues, one for each actor; actors communicate exclusively by exchanging messages

Runtime | Description
------- | -------
[tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) (multithreaded) | thread pool with work-stealing scheduler: each processor maintains its own run queue; idle processor checks sibling processor run queues, and attempts to steal tasks from them
[actix_rt](https://docs.rs/actix-rt/latest/actix_rt/) | single-threaded async runtime; futures are `!Send`
[actix](https://crates.io/crates/actix) | actor framework
[actix-web](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web) | constructs an application instance for each thread; application data must be constructed multiple times or shared between threads

## Terminology

**Shared reference**: An immutable reference (`&T`); can be copied/cloned.

**Exclusive reference**: A mutable reference (`&mut T`); cannot be copied/cloned.

**Aliasing**: Having several immutable references.

**Mutability**: Having one mutable reference.

**[Data race](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html)**: Two or more threads concurrently accessing a location of memory; one or more of them is a write; one or more of them is unsynchronized.

**[Race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition)**: The condition of a software system where the system's substantive behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events.

**[Deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)**: Any situation in which no member of some group of entities can proceed because each waits for another member, including itself, to take action.

**[Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)**: A heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it. For example, time-sensitive bugs such as race conditions may not occur when the program is slowed down by single-stepping source lines in the debugger.

**Marker trait**: Used to give the compiler certain guarantees (see [`std::marker`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/index.html)).

**Thread**: A native OS thread.

**[Green threads (or virtual threads)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads)**: Threads that are scheduled by a runtime library or virtual machine (VM) instead of natively by the underlying operating system (OS).

[**Context switch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch): The process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.

**Synchronous I/O**: blocking I/O.

**Asynchronous I/O**: non-blocking I/O.

**Future** (cf. promise): A single value produced asynchronously.

**Stream**: A series of values produced asynchronously.

**Sink**: Write data asynchronously.

**Task**: An asynchronous green thread.

**Channel**: Enables communication between threads or tasks.

**Mutex** (mutual exclusion): Shares data between threads or tasks.

**Interior mutability**: A design pattern that allows mutating data even when there are immutable references to that data.

**Executor**: Runs asynchronous tasks.

**Generator**: Used internally by the compiler. Can stop (or *yield*) its execution and resume (`poll`) afterwards from its last yield point by inspecting the previously stored state in `self`.

**Reactor**: Leaf futures register event sources with the *reactor*.

**Runtime**: Bundles a reactor and an executor.

**`poll`ing**: Attempts to resolve the future into a final value.

**[io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring)**: A Linux kernel system call interface for storage device asynchronous I/O operations.

**[CPU-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU-bound)**: Refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the speed of the CPU.

**[I/O bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound)**: Refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound.
